A collection of my personal installation scripts.

Once I find the proper configuration for a library,
  I would rather not forget the appropriate flags for compilation.
Therefore, wrapping everything in scripts.

These are not intended to be used directly,
  as they execute arbitrary code downloaded from the internet.
Instead, they should be followed step by step.
